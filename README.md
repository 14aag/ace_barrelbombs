## Information
<br/>

**ACE Barrel Bombs** does exactly what it's named after: it adds the ability to drop explosive or cluster charges from, you guessed it, barrels.

### How to use:
1. In the editor, search for and place **[ACE] Barrel Bomb Dispenser (Large)** in your mission.
1. ACE Interact with the dispenser, and **Prepare a Barrel Bomb**.
1. You may now select between the types of fuse (*Air-burst* or *Impact detonation*), and the strength of the payload, or how many cluster munitions will be included in the barrel.
1. If your dispenser has enough materials remaining, hit **CONFIRM**. As soon as you're done, a new barrel will appear, ready to be loaded.
    1. You may also inspect any barrels and read their label in order to confirm their properties.
1. Carry the barrel to the desired Helicopter, then **Prime and load** it. 
    1. Keep in mind that vehicles only have a limited amount of barrels that can be loaded - all barrels take up the same space.
1. From the Helicopter - as either the pilot, copilot, or turret-gunners - ACE Interact with the vehicle and **Check loaded Barrel bombs**.
1. Select the desired barrel and simply hit the confirmation button.

**WARNING**: Air-burst timers shorter than 2 seconds may end up damaging your aircraft.


## FAQ
<br/>

> Why would you make this?

First of all, I wanted to give myself a little challenge to make a proper mod for ArmA 3. Secondly, it was Assad's birthday just a few days ago, so what better way to celebrate?
Also, I wanted to make something that fit the theme of the [Laws of War DLC](https://arma3.com/dlc/lawsofwar).

> Is this compatible with RHS or any other vehicle mods?

Yup. Should work with all Helicopters, I reckon.

> MP Compatible?

You bet. Both for self-hosted servers and Dedicated, works all the same.

> I want my Helicopters to start with the barrels already loaded.

[Use this function.](https://github.com/Neefay/ace_barrelbombs/blob/master/addons/barrelbombs/functions/fnc_addBarrelsToVehicle.sqf)

> Aren't these things super illegal?

[Kind of](http://www.weaponslaw.org/glossary/barrel-bomb). Regardless, be careful whenever deploying over a populated urban environment, as the paramedic/journalist/child-seeking shrapnel module is currently active, *and it never misses*.

> Bakeries mod included?

Sorry, not at this time.

## License

This mod has absolutely no license whatsoever. Steal it, edit it, rename it, twist it, suck it, jerk it or lick it, I seriously don't give a damn.
Actually if this mod ends up being used by Syrian or any guerilla forces to improve their accuracy, someone _please_ let me know so I can tell all my friends and family about it.
